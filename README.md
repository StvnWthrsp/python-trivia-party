# python-trivia-party

Amazon has decided to shut down the program providing AWS credits to Alexa developers as of June 2024. As a result, I am taking all of my Alexa skills offline. I will not add in-skill purchasing, because that is predatory and doesn't even make sense for a trivia app. Developers should not pay out of pocket for AWS resources that have zero potential to generate revenue. Instead, Amazon apparently wants the Alexa to exclusively have skills that pester users to pay up.

Python re-write of my existing Trivia Party skill for Alexa, previously written in Node.js.
